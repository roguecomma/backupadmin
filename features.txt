Things to fix/talk about
 - added env PATH=$PATH to sudo commands..need better path definition in sudoers or something
 - mysql won't connect, wrong creds. dunno why mtop works fine
 - ssh_user -> create one with .ssh key & specific sudo privs (eg call pre-canned .sh files)
 - elastic_ip not useful since it's attached to master not slave
 - Crontab file: Might need PATH= as the first line in the file -- needed it locally
