SHOULD
* server error state
* state_machine muthafucka!
* nagios server state check
* cleaner ssh error handling
* split each server into its own job so snaps aren't serial

MAYBE

* convert factories to FactoryGirl
* extract Volume as a model?  Server 1->* Volume ->* Snapshot
* factor out buckets into their own enum-type thing
* use JSON for api, not XML
* factor out snapshotting strategies
* cleaner hoptoad notification?
* some sort of event error rollup (daily, notify)
* denote snapshot as immortal
* API auth
* notify when new servers added (email?)
